# FixReddit

Provides improved reddit embeds for services such as Discord.

## About

This app is a cloudflare worker service which proxies links for reddit posts and transforms them into [Open Graph](https://ogp.me/) and [Twitter Cards](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/cards/overview/markup) meta data for unfurlers.

The main instance is currently hosted on `rxddit.com` and also works with `old.rxddit.com` and `www.rxddit.com`.

### Disclaimer

This service is provided as a best-effort and has no guarantees for availability. I take no responsibility for the uptime or whether it stops working entirely.

I do not plan on maintaining this actively or accepting further changes through pull requests. If I accept something, that does not imply I'm open for any other additions!

## Example Embeds

This has specialized handling for various types of reddit posts.

The currently supported routes are:

| Route                                       | Example                                                                                                          |
|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/r/:subreddit/comments/:id/:slug/:comment` | https://rxddit.com/r/shittymoviedetails/comments/160onpq/breaking_actor_from_home_alone_2_arrested_today/jxnkq4g |
| `/r/:subreddit/comments/:id/:slug`          | https://rxddit.com/r/shittymoviedetails/comments/160onpq/breaking_actor_from_home_alone_2_arrested_today         |
| `/r/:subreddit/comments/:id`                | https://rxddit.com/r/shittymoviedetails/comments/160onpq                                                         |
| `/r/:subreddit/s/:id`                       | https://rxddit.com/r/MemePiece/s/15w6vzg82W                                                                      |
| `/:id`                                      | https://rxddit.com/160onpq                                                                                       |

Or replacing `/r/` with `/u/` and `/user/` for profile posts.

### Image Posts

An image post is a reddit post with just an uploaded image. This provides the title and image as a large image card.

### Gallery Posts

A gallery post is a reddit post with multiple attached images. Since Discord can only show a up to four images for link embeds, the description includes a tag line that indicates the total number of images.

### Video Posts

A video post works exactly like an image post, except for providing a video instead.

### YouTube Posts

A YouTube post is a video post that links to a youtube video. The service will instead provide a link to the embed iframe, which can be handled by Discord as a youtube iframe instead. This also includes clips!

### Article Posts

Article posts are simply external links, and sometimes provide a thumbnail.
